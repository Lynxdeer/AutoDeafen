# AutoDeafen

Automatically hits a **configurable** deafen keybind (Right-Shift + H by default) when you reach a certain percentage in a level, then undeafens when you win/die. <br>
<br>
Configurable per-level in the pause menu (disabled by default).

If you're wondering why I didn't just use the Discord SDK to deafen the user, it's because it got decommissioned back in May of 2023.
